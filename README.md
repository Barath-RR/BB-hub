## Inspiration:

Basketball is one of the most popular games in the world and undoubtedly it has a very big fan base.As basketball enthusiasts we know the needs of the fans and we worked on to fullfill those needs. So here we present "BB Hub" , an user friendly community app, specially made for all the Basketball fans around the world to make their community even more stronger and bigger.

## What it does:

The "BB hub" comes up with some cool features that let all the basketball fans speak out, interact and connect within themselves and induldge in many fun and engaging activities.

## Blogging : 
Write, post, and comment in support of your favorite team and players made just for the love of basketball.

## Match Zone :
If you feel like missing the stadium atmosphere, well then we've got you covered.Join the match day Mania of the NBA/BB craziness along with lot of people of the same mentality and have fun chit chats and deep down tactical discussions with them out here exclusively in the BB hub.

## Connect:
If you wish to go out and play basketball on a fine evening but you may not have the perfect people to play with or when you're hosting a match day party and you got few more invites left. Well we're here for it with the "Connect" community feature which connects people physically and let them engage together in all the fun activities.

## Chat:
A global chat channel to communicate with the entire basketball community.

## How we built it

We built a mobile application using flutter.We used Agora API for "Match Zone" and google cloud map API for integrating the maps for "Connect" feature.We used Google Firebase for authentication and back-end cloud storage.


## Challenges we ran into

As this is the first time we built an mobile application using flutter, it was quite complicated to add on some features , but successfully we made a fine mobile app to satisfy the needs of Basketball fans.
This is the most technically complex projects we've worked on. We wrote 2300+ lines of code in 36 hours 
and we're super happy with the outcome of our application.
